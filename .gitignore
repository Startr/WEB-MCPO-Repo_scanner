I've created a comprehensive `.gitignore` file in your repo_scanner directory. This file includes patterns to ignore:

1. Python-specific files:
   - Bytecode files (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, etc.)
   - Distribution packages and build directories
   - Virtual environments (`.env`, `.venv`, etc.)

2. Testing and development artifacts:
   - Coverage reports
   - Test caches
   - Log files

3. IDE and editor specific files:
   - `.vscode/` and `.idea/` directories
   - Vim swap files

4. Project-specific patterns:
   - I've added `/repositories/*` to ignore all cloned repositories, as these are just data that your tool works with and shouldn't be tracked

This setup will ensure that only your actual code and configuration files are tracked in Git, while temporary files, cached data, and development environments are excluded.

Note that I've kept `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` as tracked files (they aren't ignored) since these should be version-controlled according to Pipenv's recommendations. This ensures that anyone using your project can recreate the exact same environment.

Would you like me to make any additional adjustments to the `.gitignore` file?
